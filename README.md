# Battleship

It's going to be cooler this time.

My aim for this project is to make the components necessary to build out a full battleship-esque terminal based game.

I say "battleship-esque" because I think the real beauty of this game is going to come from its extensibility. Maybe someday someone will include bonuses in the form of "killstreaks" or add different kinds of ships, perhaps with their own defenses and such, or munitions that have area-attack behaviors instead of point attack. The possibilities are endless, but the framework must first be laid down.

Consider it your coding enthusiast's newest pass-time.
